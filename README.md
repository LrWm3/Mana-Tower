# Mana-Tower

The current release is the alpha. Many of the textures are placeholders and the current game content has not been 'balanced' but merely serves to demonstrate the various features of the game. It has been designed to be easily extendable, but with the bulk of the system done I am putting this project on hold for a while.

## The Game

You start off with 1 mana per second as your income. As you build your tower, your income increases. It's possible to save and load your tower as well. When you load your tower, you earn all the income that it generated while you were away as well.

## To Be Added

- More Blocks
- Blocks to be balanced
- New Textures
- Height modifier to motivate higher towers
- Web Support
- Mobile Support
- Music + SFX
- Dynamic Batching & potentially pre-generated terrain
- A better build menu to hold the additional blocks
- Upgrade max build area
- Achievements for other things
- Stats page

### A little history...

This is a Unity game I worked on for a couple months. I took this project on to learn more about OO design to pick up C#. I learned an absolute ton about development working on this project. Creating the voxel engine felt really cool and I'm happy with the way the alpha turned out.
